An Ozone Action Day is issued when forecasted\nweather conditions are favorable for the formation of ozone. Ozone\nappears to be elevated in the basin when there is a presence of\nozone-forming precursor emissions including oxides of nitrogen and\nvolatile organic compounds coupled with meteorological conditions\nsuch as strong temperature inversions, low winds, snow cover, and\nsunlight.\n\nDuring the winter ozone season (January-March), everyone should\ntake actions to reduce precursor emissions and ground-level ozone\nformation.\n\nOzone is an air pollutant that can cause respiratory distress\nespecially to children, the elderly, and people with existing\nrespiratory conditions such as asthma.  People in these sensitive\ngroups should limit strenuous or extended outdoor activities,\nespecially in the afternoon and evening.\n\nFor more information on ozone and the health effects of ozone,\nplease visit the websites for the Wyoming Department of\nEnvironmental Quality at deq.wyoming.gov and the Wyoming\nDepartment of Health at www.health.wyo.gov.\n\nCurrent information on ozone levels at the Air Quality Division's\nmonitoring stations at Daniel South, Pinedale, Boulder, Big\nPiney, and Juel Spring can be found at www.wyvisnet.com.",

Many county roads still have water on\nthem due the recent flood event and it will take a while for that\nwater to drain out. Locations with feeder streams that go into the\nMissouri River, the Platte River, the Elkhorn River, the Big Blue\nRiver and the Nishnabotna River are the most likely to see water\nproblems outside of the larger river flooding. This is an\nextension and expansion of a previous areal flood warning.\n\n* Some locations that could experience flooding include...\nOmaha, Lincoln, Norfolk, Beatrice, Falls City, Council Bluffs,\nBellevue, Fremont, Papillion, La Vista, Blair, Nebraska City,\nSeward, Crete, Plattsmouth, Ralston, Wayne, Glenwood, Gretna and\nAuburn.\n\n* Stay out of flooded areas. Turn around, don't drown when\nencountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.",

An Ozone Action Day is issued when forecasted\nweather conditions are favorable for the formation of ozone. Ozone\nappears to be elevated in the basin when there is a presence of\nozone-forming precursor emissions including oxides of nitrogen and\nvolatile organic compounds coupled with meteorological conditions\nsuch as strong temperature inversions, low winds, snow cover, and\nsunlight.\n\nDuring the winter ozone season (January-March), everyone should\ntake actions to reduce precursor emissions and ground-level ozone\nformation.\n\nOzone is an air pollutant that can cause respiratory distress\nespecially to children, the elderly, and people with existing\nrespiratory conditions such as asthma.  People in these sensitive\ngroups should limit strenuous or extended outdoor activities,\nespecially in the afternoon and evening.\n\nFor more information on ozone and the health effects of ozone,\nplease visit the websites for the Wyoming Department of\nEnvironmental Quality at deq.wyoming.gov and the Wyoming\nDepartment of Health at www.health.wyo.gov.\n\nCurrent information on ozone levels at the Air Quality Division's\nmonitoring stations at Daniel South, Pinedale, Boulder, Big\nPiney, and Juel Spring can be found at www.wyvisnet.com.",
